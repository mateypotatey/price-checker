# Webscraper and price notification script

This app is useful if you're interested in a particular item on a website and want to see when the price changes (for example the item goes on sale). It then will send you an email to inform you of this price change. 

In my two scripts, I'm keeping an eye on a D&D bookset on bookdepository.com, as well as a number of scuba diving regulator sets from deepstop.de

## Requirements:
### You want to pip install the following packages:

beautifulsoup4 <br>
requests

#### If using gmail to send you email notifications, also install the following:
google-api-python-client <br>
google-auth-httplib2 <br>
google-auth-oauthlib<br>
google-auth<br>
google-api-core<br>
googleapis-common-protos<br>
